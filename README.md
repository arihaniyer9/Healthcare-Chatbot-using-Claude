# Healthcare-Chatbot-using-Claude-and-ML

## Description
This is a chatbot designed to assist parents of malnourished or sickly children in obtaining nutritional advice and support. By answering 5-8 simple questions about the child's diet, environment, and financial capacity, the chatbot provides:

1. A preliminary diagnosis and personalized diet plan to help improve the childâ€™s condition (if reversible without a doctor's assistance).
2. Recommendations for nearby doctors if the condition appears too severe (based on the user's location).

This project leverages Claude's advanced AI capabilities along with machine learning to deliver efficient and accurate recommendations.
